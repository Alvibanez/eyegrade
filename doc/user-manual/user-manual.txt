Grading Exams
-------------

The main purpose of Eyegrade is grading exams. In order to grade exams,
you will need:

- The Eyegrade software installed in your computer.
- The exam configuration file, which specifies the number
  of questions in the exam, solutions, etc. It is normally named
  *exam.eye*.
- A compatible webcam, with minimum resolution 640x480.
- The list of students in your class, if you want Eyegrade to
  detect student IDs.
- The exams to grade.


Launching Eyegrade
..................

Eyegrade can be launched from command line::

    python -m eyegrade.eyegrade exam.eye

where ``exam.eye`` is the file that holds the configuration of the
exam (number of questions, geometry of tables, correct answers, etc.)

If you want Eyegrade to read student's identity, it is recommended to
provide it with the list of students in class::

    python -m eyegrade.eyegrade exam.eye --id-list student-list.csv


where ``student-list.csv`` is a tabulator-separated file in which
there are one line per student. The first column must be the student
identifier.  The second column (optional) must be the student
name. Other columns, if present, are ignored.

Eyegrade will start up and show its graphical interface, as shown in
the next picture:

   :alt: Eyegrade main window

The interface is quite simple:

- The output of the webcam is shown in the main area of the window.

- A toolbar is shown at the right. We will go through the meaning of these
  buttons later.

- Two status lines are shown at the bottom. They show different pieces
  of information depending on the currently active mode.


Application modes
.................

At a given instant, the application is in one of these two modes:

- *Search mode*: the application continually scans the input from the webcam,
  looking foir a correct detection of an exam.

- *Review mode*: the application shows a still capture of an exam with the
  result of the grading, so that the user can review the result and
  fix things if necessary before saving the score of the exam.

Obviously, the application starts in the *search mode*. When the
system detects an answer sheet that can be read, it locks the capture
and enters the *review mode*. Once you save the score of the exam,
Eyegrade automatically goes back to the *search mode* in order to scan
the next exam.


The search mode
...............

In the *search mode*, you have to get the camera to point to the answer table
of the exam, including, if present, the id box above it and the small squares
at the bottom.
